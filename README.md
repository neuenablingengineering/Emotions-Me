# Emotions and Me

Spring 2019 Capstone Project

Group Members: Mary Forde, Naveen Sehgal, Babatunde Egbantan, Cassandra Smith, and Jenny Cheung

This is a website that helps children on the autism spectrum who have trouble recognizing and expressing emotions.

The code is divided into two folders: a frontend, written in ReactJS/CSS, and backend, written in Django. 

NOTE: The Django 'SECRET_KEY', located in the settings.py file, is included in this code set. This is fine for demo/prototype purposes, but should be reset and not committed to GitHub in a production scenario.
